List the items on the sprint backlog as it is defined at the conclusion of the planning meeting 
One paragraph, no more than 300 words, explaining how and why the sprint backlog items were chosen by the team 

The items on the sprint backlog were chosen because they are viewed as foundational to the application, 
meaning they are the items upon which other functions and features will build upon later on. We chose 
the items of ‘creating an account’ and ‘login’ because logically they are the first features a user encounters,
moreover the information received from those tasks are critical data to be stored in the database. 
The creation of the database is also important because it will store all the data in the application. 
The items of ‘proposing group date’ and ‘receive and respond to group date proposal’ are chosen because they 
seem to be the primary and key function of the application and thus are chosen to begin with, particularly since
they are a large part of the front end implementation.
